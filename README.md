Scaffolding
===========

The Scaffolding Minetest mod adds instantly removeable, climbable nodebox
frames.  The intent is to make it easier to build large projects without fly
privledges.  If the dye mod is available, colored scaffolding is also added.

Crafting:

|       |       |       |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| stick |       | stick |
|       | stick |       |
| stick |       | stick |
